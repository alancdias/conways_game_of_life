<h1>Basic implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python.</h1>

<h2>Game Rules:</h2>
<p>At each iteration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any alive cell with less than two alive neighbours gets really sad and dies of loneliness.</li>
<li>Any alive cell with more than three alive neighbours gets terribly claustrophobic and dies of overpopulation.</li>
<li>Any cell with exactly three alive neighbours becomes an alive cell.</li>
<li>Any cell with exactly two alive neighbours stays in the current status in the next iteration.</li>
</ol>
<p>The GUI was made using PyGame.</p>
